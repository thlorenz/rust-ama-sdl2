# lazy foo rust

Reimplementing the great [Lazy Foo's Production SDL
Tutorial](https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/) in Rust.

## Lessons

### 01 Hello SDL

- [tutorial](https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/index.php)

This one has no file associated as it's just an explanation on how to install SDL.

I recommend to also refer to instructions in the [main readme](../README.md).

### 02 Image On the Screen

```sh
cargo run --bin 02_image_on_screen
```

- [tutorial](https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/02_getting_an_image_on_the_screen/index.php)
- [rust code](./src/02_image_on_screen.rs)
- [read up on high-dpi-mode](https://nlguillemot.wordpress.com/2016/12/11/high-dpi-rendering/) which is an option when creating the window
